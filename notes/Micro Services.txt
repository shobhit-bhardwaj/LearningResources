Microservices Advantages

1. Scaling Easy
2. Deployment Easy
3. Technology Usage
4. Faster to Develop, Understand
5. Loosely Coupled



Microservices Disadvantages

1. Interprocess Communication
2. Distributed Transaction
3. More Repository
4. Debugging Issues



Functional Decomposition

We can decompose an e-com website with its functionally independent modules -
1. Search of Product
2. Rating and Reviews
3. Users
4. Payment and Billing
5. Shipping
6. Notification



Polyglot Persistence

Persistence Data can further divided according to its nature.
1. Session Data, Shopping Carts							(Key/Value)
2. Product Catalog, User Accounts, Domain Objects		(MongoDB)
3. payment System, Reporting							(RDBMS)
4. Social Data, Recommandation							(Graph)



Scale Cube
X-Axis	-	Horizontal Scaling			(Adding more instances of similar service)
Y-Axis	-	Data Partitioning			(Processing part of the data by a service instance)
Z-Axis	-	Functional Decomposition	(You can keep decomposing the service to certain degree. Ex:- Reviews and Rating can decompose to two different services)



API Gateway

Benefits of API Gateway
1. Authentication
2. SSL Termination
3. Load Balancing
4. Insulation
5. Caching
6. API Health Monitoring
7. API Versioning
8. Chaos Monkey Testing

Multiple API Gateway for the multiple type of Clients. Like -
API GW1 - Mobile
API GW2 - Web
API GW3 - Third Party

Backend For FrontEnd (BFF)
With BFF, you can also do have -
1. One API Gateway for Android Apps
2. One API Gateway for IOS Apps

This way, we can compose different APIs and different response for different client using the same microservices.
Also we can track the usage and rate limit the third party API usages.
